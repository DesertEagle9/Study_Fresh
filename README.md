Study Fresh Project for air quality monitoring

Currently working on a Beta Prototype. In terms of functionality, the prototype can:
> Sample DTH22 and MH-Z19 sensors once every 10 seconds and print to LCD;
> Average sampled values for a minute; 
> Write to CSV every minute based on averages for the past minute;
> Run automatically upon boot based on commands in .bashrc;
> Log in a new CSV file whenever the program reboots
> Store previous CSV values during unexpected interruptions
